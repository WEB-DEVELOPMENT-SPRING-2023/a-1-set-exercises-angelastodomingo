    <h1>Honey Garlic Chicken</h1>
    <p>This simple recipe makes a crisp-tender chicken with a perfect, sticky glaze.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 6 chicken thighs, bone in or out, with or without skin* </li>
        <li> Salt and pepper, to season </li>
        <li> 2 teaspoons garlic powder, to season </li>
        <li> 6 cloves garlic, crushed </li>
        <li> 1/3 cup honey </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup water (or chicken broth) </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar, or any white vinegar) </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon soy sauce </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> METHOD </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder; set aside.</li>

        <li>Heat a pan or skillet over medium high heat; sear chicken thigh fillets or breast fillets on both sides until golden and cooked through.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3> FOR BONE IN THIGHS: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Reduce heat after searing on both sides, cover skillet with a lid and continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through, while turning every 5 minutes until done. Alternatively, see notes for oven method.</li>

        <li>Drain most of the excess oil from the pan, leaving about 2 tablespoons of pan juiced for added flavour. </li>
    </ol>

    <h3> FOR SAUCE: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>When chicken is done and cooked through, arrange chicken skin-side up in the pan (if cooking with skin); add the garlic between the chicken and fry until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add the honey, water, vinegar and soy sauce. Increase heat to medium-high and continue to cook until the sauce reduces down and thicken slightly (about 3-4 minutes).</li>

        <li>Garnish with parsley and serve over vegetables, rice, pasta or with a salad.</li>


    </ol>
