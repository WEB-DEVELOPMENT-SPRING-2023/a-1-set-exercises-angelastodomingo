<div class="box">Pulp Fiction's narrative is told out of chronological order and follows three main interrelated stories that each have a different protagonist: Vincent Vega, a hitman; Butch Coolidge, a prizefighter; and Jules Winnfield, Vincent's business partner.
<br>
<br>
    The film begins with a diner hold-up staged by a couple, then begins to shift from one storyline to another before returning to the diner for the conclusion. There are seven narrative sequences; the three primary storylines are preceded by intertitles:
<br>
<br>
    "Prologue The Diner" (i)
<br>
<br>
    Prelude to "Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife"
<br>
<br>
    "Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife"
<br>
<br>
    Prelude to "The Gold Watch" (a. flashback, b. present)
<br>
<br>
    "The Gold Watch"
<br>
<br>
    "The Bonnie Situation"
<br>
<br>
    "Epilogue The Diner" (ii)
<br>
<br>
    If the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 4b, 5. Sequences 1 and 7 partially overlap and are presented from different points of view, as do sequences 2 and 6. According to Philip Parker, the structural form is "an episodic narrative with circular events adding a beginning and end and allowing references to elements of each separate episode to be made throughout the narrative". Other analysts describe the structure as a "circular narrative".
