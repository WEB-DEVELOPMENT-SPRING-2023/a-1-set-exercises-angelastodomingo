<p>Tarantino's guilty secret, which the international critics should have noticed, is that his films are cultural hybrids.
    <br>
    - Richard Corliss, TIME magazine 
    <br>
    <br>
    Tarantino's dialogue, with its densely propulsive, almost lawyerly fervor, its peppery comic blend of literacy and funk, has more snap and fight than most directors' action scenes.
    <br>
    - Owen Gleiberman, Entertainment Weekly 
    <br>
    <br>
    If you smile at David Mamet's dialogue, you'll laugh out loud at the words of Quentin Tarantino.
    <br>
    - Gene Siskel, Chicago Tribune 
    <br>
    <br>
     At 153 minutes, the movie does occasionally flirt with tedium, but the risk is worth it: The whole is finally greater than the sum of its pulpy parts. What could have been an anything-goes pastiche has surprising rigor and narrative clarity.
    <br>
    - John Hartl, Seattle Times 
    <br>
    <br>
    It's full of perfect Tarantino moments, with meta references, B-movie sleaze and a sheer sense of fun.
